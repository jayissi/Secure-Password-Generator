## ‚ú® Features

- **Cryptographically Secure**:
  Utilizes Python's `secrets` module, which is designed to generate unpredictable random values suitable for cryptographic purposes.

- **Flexible Password Policies**:
  - Minimum enforced length (8+ characters, configurable)
  - Uppercase letters (`A-Z`)
  - Lowercase letters (`a-z`)
  - Digits (`0-9`)
  - Symbols (customizable or default punctuation)
  - Minimum character requirements per character type
  - Prevent consecutive duplicate characters
  - Exclude similar-looking characters (`i`, `l`, `1`, `L`, `o`, `0`, `O`)

- **Advanced options**:
  - Generate multiple passwords at once
  - View previously generated passwords

- **Argon2id Salt+Pepper & Timestamp**  
  Each password is accompanied by:  
  - A **unique Argon2id Salt+Pepper** (16 bytes, Base64-encoded)  
  - A **derived Argon2id hash** (512-bit digest, Base64-encoded)  
  - A **timestamp** recording when it was created

- **Secure Encryption & Storage**  
  - Password records (including Salt + Pepper + hash + timestamp) are serialized as JSON  
  - Encrypted with **AES-GCM-SIV**, which provides nonce misuse resistance  
  - Encoded safely in **Base64**, one entry per line, to prevent file corruption  
  - Stored at `${HOME}/.password_list.enc` with owner-only permissions (`0600`)

- **User-Friendly CLI**:
  Clean interface powered by `argparse` with grouped options and helpful usage examples

- **Zero Dependencies**:
  Pure Python script. No external libraries are needed‚Äîjust a standard Python 3 installation.

## üìù Examples

**1. Generate and save a password (16 chars, all types)**
Create a 16-character password using all character types and save it to `${HOME}/.password_list.enc`.

```bash
password_generator -L 16 -u -l -d -s
```

**Output:**

```bash
Generated Password 1: p@55W0rD_Ex&mpl3
[‚úì] Passwords securely saved to ${HOME}/.password_list.enc
```

<br/>

**2. Generate a 26-character password (no repeats, do not save)**
This creates a 26-character password with no repetitive characters.

```bash
password_generator -L 26 --upper --lower --digits --symbols --no-repeats --no-save
```

**Output:**

```bash
Generated Password 1: V3ry-L0ng&S3cur3!P@ssw0rd#
```

<br/>

**3. Generate a password with strict requirements**
Create a 16-character password with at least 2 of each selected character type.

```bash
password_generator -L 16 --upper --lower --digits --symbols --no-repeats --min 2 --no-save
```

<br/>

**4. Use a custom symbol set**
Create a password using only `@#$%` as symbols

```bash
password_generator -n -u -l -a '@#$%'
```

<br/>

**5. Advanced Requirements**
Create (5x) 20-character password with:

- At least 3 of each character type
- No similar characters
- No consecutive duplicates
- Only use `!@*#^ $&%\"` as valid symbols
- Output to stdout only

```bash
password_generator -c 5 -L 20 -u -l -d -m 3 -e -r -a '!@*#^ $&%\"' -n
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Details

This tool is designed with security as a top priority. `JSON Payload ‚Üí Argon2id(salt+pepper) ‚Üí Encrypt ‚Üí Store`

- **Randomness**: Uses Python‚Äôs `secrets` module, not `random`, ensuring cryptographic quality randomness.

- **Minimum Length**: Enforces a minimum of 8 characters, with recommended defaults of 12+.

- **AES-GCM-SIV Encryption**: Provides misuse-resistant authenticated encryption; records are Base64-encoded per line to prevent newline corruption.

- **Argon2id Hashing**: Each password is hashed with Argon2id using a unique 16-byte Salt+Pepper. The AES key file also serves as a pepper, further protecting against offline brute force attacks.

- **Timestamp**: Each password entry is stamped with creation time.

- **File Permissions**: The password history file is created with `0600` file permissions (read/write) restricted to the file‚Äôs owner.

<br/>

### üßÇ Salt vs üå∂Ô∏è Pepper

When protecting passwords, two important concepts are often combined: **salt** and **pepper**. Both strengthen security, but they serve very different purposes.

#### üßÇ Salt

- A **salt** is a unique, random value generated for each password.  
- It ensures that even if two users choose the same password, their hashes will be different.  
- Salts protect against **rainbow table** and precomputed dictionary attacks.  
- **Not secret** ‚Äî salts are usually stored alongside the password hash in the database.

#### üå∂Ô∏è Pepper

- A **pepper** is an additional **secret value** (like a hidden key) used during hashing.  
- Unlike salts, peppers are **not stored with the hashes**. Instead, they‚Äôre kept in a secure location such as:
  - A configuration file with restricted access
  - An environment variable
  - A Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- If an attacker steals the database, they cannot brute-force hashes without also knowing the pepper.

#### üîê Why Both?

- **Salt** defends against precomputation attacks and ensures uniqueness.  
- **Pepper** adds an extra layer of defense ‚Äî even if the database is leaked, the attacker still needs the hidden pepper to verify guesses.  
- Together, salt and pepper provide **defense in depth**, making password cracking far more difficult.

**Key Differences:**  

- Salt = *public, unique, stored with the hash* (e.g. *public spice* per password.)
- Pepper = *private, shared, stored separately* (e.g. *secret ingredient* known only to the chef.)

<br/>

Here is a simple flow chart:

## üîê Argon2id + AES-GCM-SIV Encryption Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as JSON Payload (P)
    participant A as Argon2id<br/>(Salt + Pepper)
    participant K as Derived Key (K)
    participant E as AES-GCM-SIV<br/>(Encryption)
    participant O as Output

    P->>A: Input secret
    A->>K: Derive secure key
    K->>E: Provide key
    P->>E: Provide JSON Payload + nonce
    E->>O: Ciphertext (C) + Auth Tag (T)
```

### üìù Explanation

1. **JSON Payload (P)** is the input secret (e.g., a password).  
2. **Argon2id** takes the JSON Payload, adds a **random salt** and a secret **pepper**, and produces a strong, memory-hard **derived key**.  
3. The **derived key (K)** `Key + Nonce + JSON Payload` is fed into **AES-GCM-SIV** as the encryption key.  
4. AES-GCM-SIV produces both **Ciphertext (C)** and an **Authentication Tag (T)** for integrity.  
5. The final secure output is stored as `{ salt, nonce, ciphertext, tag }` where only the **pepper** remains secret.

> [!CAUTION]
> You are responsible for the secure management of the `${HOME}/.password_list.enc` file and the `${HOME}/.password_key.aes256` key file.  
> Ensure it is stored and secured properly and ***do not share or back them up insecurely***.
